## Reading strategies

### Pre-reading
* Title - What does the title tell you about the content of the book?
* Table of contents - What does the table of contents tell you about the structure of the book?
* Index - How extensively are your the people, places, or ideas, from your research topic covered in the book?

### Selective reading
* Read the introduction and conclusion first.
* Scan the index to find and read the pages/chapters relevant to your research topic.

### Para-reading
* Find 2-3 book reviews of the book in academic journals.
* What can you learn from the reviewer's evaluation of the book?
* What can you learn about the book's place in the wider scholarly conversation?

### In-depth reading
* Interrogate the text:
    * What claim is the author making?
    * What arguments are made to advance the claim?
    * What evidence is offered in support of the arguments?

### Source reading

* **Background**: a source to provide general information to explain the topic.
* **Exhibit**: a source as evidence or examples to analyze.
* **Argument**: a source to engage its argument.
* **Method**: a sourceâ€™s way of analyzing an issue to apply to your own issue.
